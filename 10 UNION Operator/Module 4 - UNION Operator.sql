-- Non-correlated sub-query in a predicate
SELECT sod.SalesOrderDetailID, sod.SalesOrderID
FROM [Sales].[SalesOrderDetail] AS sod
WHERE sod.SalesOrderID IN 
	(SELECT SalesOrderID 
	 FROM [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader]
	 WHERE AccountNumber = '10-4020-000510');

-- Correlated sub-query join
SELECT soh.SalesOrderID
FROM [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader] AS soh
WHERE soh.SalesOrderID IN
	(SELECT SalesOrderID
	 FROM [Sales].[SalesOrderDetail] AS sod
	 WHERE soh.SalesOrderID = sod.SalesOrderID AND
